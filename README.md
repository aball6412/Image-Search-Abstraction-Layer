# Image-Search-Abstraction-Layer
FCC API Project

This API project takes in a search query as a parameter and returns image URLs, page URLs, and alt text for images related to the search query.

To get the search results, we utilize the imgur.com API .

The user can also paginate through the responses by adding an offset parameter.

Finally, the user can get a list of the most recent search terms submitted through our app.
